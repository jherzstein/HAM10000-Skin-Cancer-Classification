#+TITLE: Skin Cancer Classification Model
#+AUTHOR: Jordan Herzstein, Bryson Reid, Henry Chen

* Introduction
This project utilizes the H10000 dataset which labels cancerous and non-cancerous human skin images to create a model with pytorch to identify and label images as cancerous or non-cancerous.

* How to Create
** Download Dataset
Make sure that you have a [[https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api#authentication][Kaggle API token]] and use ~download-dataset.py~ to download the dataset. Alternatively use the CLI tool [[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/surajghuwalewala/ham1000-segmentation-and-classification/data][download the H10000 dataset manually]], just make sure you unzip the dataset in the ~/data~ directory.

** Build Dataset
Convert dataset into proper directory format using ~build-dataset.py~, it creates ~/data/train~ and ~/data/val~ and sub folders in each of those classes so that it can be used by pytorch.
